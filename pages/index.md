# Welcome

I built my **Writing Samples** document library using Jekyll hosted on GitHub (gh-pages) and markdown for writing the content. I created it as a recent challenge; plus, I wanted a way to show my writing samples in a format other than a README.md file on GitHub. 

You can find a variety of writing samples from blog articles to getting started guides all the way down to UX writing for UI stings and group policies. I continue to challenge myself and add more samples when I can, so check back often.  

If you are interested in starting a conversation with me, feel free to [pencil in 15 minutes](https://calendly.com/pattishort/15min) to chat. I'm always looking for a new problem to solve. 

~ Thank you.
