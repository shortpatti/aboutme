# Welcome

The Writing Samples document library was built using Jekyll hosted on GitHub (gh-pages) and markdown for writing the content. I built this document library as a recent challenge I was given.  

<hr />

My expertise is in taking the guesswork out of complex technical content for busy IT professionals. I am a self-driven Sr. Technical UX Writer with a degree and strong background in computer networking and system administration, and more than 20 years in the tech industry. Over the last ten years, I have helped organizations reduce, simplify, and restructure their content, ensuring quality and accuracy, and increasing overall customer satisfaction rates.

You can find a variety of writing samples from blog articles to getting started guides all the way down to UX writing for UI stings and group policies.
