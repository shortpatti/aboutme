# Patti Short's Writing Sample Repository

I have a vast array of writing experience as well as instructional design, visual design, video production, as well as voice over.  I wanted a way to show my writing samples in a format other than a README.md file on GitHub. Please read about my experience, skills, and training below.  

If you are interested in starting a conversation with me, feel free to [pencil in some time to chat](https://calendly.com/pattishort/15min). I'm always looking for a new problem to solve. 

~ Thank you.
