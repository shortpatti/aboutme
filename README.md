# Patti Short's Writing Sample Repository

The Writing Samples document library was built using Jekyll hosted on GitHub (gh-pages) and markdown for writing the content. I built this document library as a recent challenge I was given.  I started using markdown in 2015, but have use it with Jekyll and GitHub steadily since early 2018.  

Please take a look around at my [writing samples](https://shortpatti.github.io/aboutme/). If you are interested in starting a conversation with me, feel free to [pencil in some time to chat](https://calendly.com/pattishort/15min). I'm always looking for a new problem to solve. 

~ Thank you.
