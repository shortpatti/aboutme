>Sr. Technical Writer \| UX Writer \| Visual Designer \| Voiceover Professional<br /> 
> *I am passionate about creating content experiences that help IT Pros achieve more with technology.*

I specialize in taking the guesswork out of complex technical content for busy IT professionals. I am an experienced and self-driven Technical Writer with a degree and a strong background in computer networking and system administration, and more than 20 years in the tech industry. Proudly, over the last ten years, I have helped organizations reduce, simplify, and restructure their content, ensuring quality and accuracy, and increasing overall customer satisfaction rates.

- Rewrote a decades-old installation/upgrade guide for the GE Healthcare customers and support team reducing the time to install/upgrade, data loss or corruption, and support calls.
- As a MadCap Flare Conversion Specialist, built a _**custom**_ authoring environment and converted legacy content for several large corporations maximizing content reuse and reducing the cost of creating, managing, and publishing content.
